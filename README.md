<!-- STRONG -->
This is an example of **strong text**. Anything between two opening asterisks and two closing asterisks will be displayed as a **strong text**.

This is another example of a way to have __strong text__ in our document. Anything betwwen the two double opening underscore and closing underscore will be displayed as __strong text__.

<!-- STRIKE THROUGH -->
This is an example of ~~strike through~~ text. Anything in between the double tilde opening characters and double tilde closing characters will be displayed as ~~strike through~~.

---

<!-- HORIZONTAL RULE -->
We can add triple hypens to be able to create a horizontal rule for content separation.

Another way to create horizontal rules is by using three underscores.

<!-- ESCAPE CHARACTER RULES USING BACKSLASH -->
This is an example of *text with an asterisk*. When we don't want it to be italicized, we want to use the backslash \ to escape the rule of using an opening \*asterisk* and closing \*asterisk* to enclose the text content. 

---

<!-- BLOCKQUOTE RULE -->
> We us the greater than symbol to display a block of text as a quote with a background and line on the left side.

> *"You don't have to be great to start, but you need to start to be great."* __-Unknown Author__
